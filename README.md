Electronic Drum set featuring piezo-triggered drum pads build from scratch. The project consists of the following components:
* Electronic drums and cymbals
* Kick (Bass) drum pedal and trigger
* Drum module - converts the raw sensor outputs from the drums into drum sounds
* Drum set chassis and mounting hardware
